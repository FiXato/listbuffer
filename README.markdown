# listbuffer.py, version 0.1 for WeeChat version 0.3
******************************************************************************

Show /list results in a common buffer and interact with them.

This script allows you to easily join channels from the /list output. 
It will open a common buffer for the /list result, through which you 
browse with your cursor keys, and join with the enter key.

This is a script for the WeeChat chat client, www.weechat.org

## Notes on Patches/Pull Requests
******************************************************************************

1. Fork the project.
2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.
3. Add tests for it (even though I don't have tests myself at the moment). 
  This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
4. Commit, but do not mess with gemspec, version, history, or README.
  Want to have your own version? Bump version in a separate commit!
  That way I can ignore that commit when I pull.
5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
6. You'll be added to the credits.

## Acknowledgements
******************************************************************************

Thanks go out to:

* Sebastien "Flashcode" Helleu, for developing the kick-ass IRC client WeeChat
    and the iset.pl script which inspired me to this script.
* Nils "nils_2" GÃ¶rs, for his contributions to iset.pl which served as
    example code.
* David "drubin" Rubin, for his urlgrab.py script, which also served
    as example code.
* ArZa, whose listsort.pl script helped me getting started with 
    grabbing the /list results. Parts of his code have been shamelessly
    copied and ported to Python.
* Khaled Mardam-Bey, for making me yearn for similar /list support in 
    WeeChat as mIRC already offered. :P
